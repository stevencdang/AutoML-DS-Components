## LearnSphere and Tigris

[LearnSphere](LearnSphere.org) is co-developed by the [LearnLab](http://learnlab.org) â€“ a flagship project of [Carnegie Mellon](http://cmu.edu)'s [Simon Initiative](https://www.cmu.edu/simon). It is community software infrastructure for sharing, analysis, and collaboration of/around educational data. LearnSphere integrates existing and new educational data infrastructures to offer a world class repository of education data. 

[Tigris](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/LearnSphereLogin) is a workflow authoring tool which is part of the community software infrastructure being built for the LearnSphere project. The platform provides a way to create custom analyses and interact with new as well as existing data formats and repositories.

## System Dependencies
* Python 2.7
* VirtualEnv

## New Install Instructions

From within WorkflowComponents directory execute:

```bash
./runWCC.sh . <path_to_D3MDatasetSelector.git>/wcc.properties
cd D3MDatasetSelector
cp <path_to_D3MDatasetSelector.git>/install_component.sh .
cp <path_to_D3MDatasetSelector.git>/README.md .
cp <path_to_D3MDatasetSelector.git>/requirements.txt .
mv build.properties build.properties.sample
./install_component.sh
```

This should generate a new component using the source in the program folder. Then after entering the new autogenerated folder, running the install script will create a python virtualenv, install python dependencies, and use the build.properties.sample to configure a build.properties

## Re-Install Instructions

In order to reinstall due to errors in teh install script you simply have to `rm -R env` to delete the virtualenv.
